# LaTeX Thesis Template

This repository contains a LaTeX template for writing Bachelor's or Master's thesis in engineering and science fields. The template is designed to be easy to use and provides all necessary components for a structured thesis document, including a title page, abstract, table of contents, appendix, and more.

## Features
- **Title Page**: Two customizable title pages according to academic standards.
- **Abstract and Acknowledgements**: Easily include or comment out abstract and acknowledgements sections.
- **Structured Chapters**: Predefined structure for introduction, methodology, results, and conclusion.
- **Page Numbering**: Proper page numbering styles for different sections, with Roman numerals for the appendix.
- **Glossary and Abbreviations**: Integrated support for glossary and acronyms.

## How to Use
1. **Download the ZIP File**: Download the ZIP file containing the template and extract it on your local machine.
2. **Import to Overleaf**: For smaller documents, you can import the ZIP directly to [Overleaf](https://www.overleaf.com/).
3. **Compile the Document**: You can also compile the `main.tex` file using a local LaTeX editor such as TeXShop, TeXstudio, or any other TeX editor. 
4. **Adjust Settings**: Modify the contents to fit your thesis, including adding chapters, updating the title page, and more.

## Requirements
- **TeX Distribution**: Make sure to have a full TeX distribution installed (e.g., [TeX Live](https://www.tug.org/texlive/), [MiKTeX](https://miktex.org/)).
- **Editor**: Any LaTeX editor like [TeXstudio](https://www.texstudio.org/) or [Overleaf](https://www.overleaf.com/).
- **Python and Pygments**: If you are using `minted` for code listings, you need Python and the `Pygments` package installed.
